Hi [Client Name],

To connect your custom domain to the website, I need:

1. Domain name: _______________
2. Domain registrar: _______________ (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)
3. DNS access: Please make the DNS changes yourself (I'll provide you with the exact DNS settings to add)
4. Preferred setup: Both www.yourdomain.com and yourdomain.com (we'll set up both)

Once I have the domain name and registrar information, I'll configure everything in Netlify and provide you with the exact DNS settings you need to add at your registrar.

Thanks!
